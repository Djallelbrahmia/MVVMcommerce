🚀 Flutter E-Commerce App with Dummy API

Welcome to my Flutter E-Commerce app repository! 🛍️ This project is a result of an advanced Flutter course, where I delved into Clean Architecture with MVVM, reactive programming, and various Flutter packages. Here's what you'll find:

Clean Architecture: Follows the principles of Clean Architecture for maintainability and scalability.
MVVM Pattern: Utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel pattern for a clear separation of concerns.
Reactive Programming: Embraces reactive programming with Stream Controller, RX Dart, and Stream Builder.
Dummy API: Simulates real-world scenarios with a dummy API for seamless testing and development.
Localization: Supports English and Arabic languages with RTL-LTR layout support.
Theme Management: Implements a robust system for managing assets, styles, themes, and more.
State Management: Leverages state management techniques for smooth user interfaces.
18 Flutter Packages: Integrates 18 essential Flutter packages for enhanced functionality.
Device Info Retrieval: Gathers device information for Android and iOS platforms.
🔍 Explore the Source Code:

Application Layer: Dependency Injection, Routes Manager, and Application class.
Data Layer: Remote and Local Data Sources, API Service Client, Logger Interceptor.
Domain Layer: Models, Repository Interfaces, UseCases, Either Concepts.
